# Task 2: Auth-webapp

Create a simple web application with a login page and homepage. The login page
should have three fields:

    i. Name
    ii. Date of birth
    iii.Password

Determine the approximate age from the date of birth. If the age is above 50 or below 18, show
them an error message and do not send the name and password to the server for authentication.
The password and name should be authenticated by a node (Express) server written in
typescript (Hardcoded values). If the authentication is successful, navigate the user to a
homepage displaying their name and age.
